# WhatsApp Session Restoration Test

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced RemoteAuth Configuration
- Reduced backup sync interval from 5 minutes to 1 minute
- Increased Puppeteer timeout from 90s to 120s
- Added additional Puppeteer args for better stability

### 2. Improved Session Restoration Logic
- Increased restoration timeout from 30s to 60s
- Added proper event handling for RemoteAuth
- Added S3 existence check before fallback
- Better error handling and logging

### 3. Force Backup Implementation
- Added `forceBackupSessionToS3()` method with retry logic
- Immediate backup verification after session becomes ready
- Database confirmation of successful backup

## Test Steps

1. **Start Server**: `yarn dev`
2. **Create Session**: POST `/webjs/sessions` with user_id
3. **Initialize**: POST `/webjs/sessions/{sessionId}/initialize`
4. **Scan QR Code**: Use WhatsApp mobile app
5. **Send Message**: POST `/webjs/sessions/{sessionId}/send-message`
6. **Restart Server**: Stop and start again
7. **Verify Restoration**: Check if session auto-restores without QR
8. **Send Message Again**: Verify messaging works immediately

## Expected Behavior

### Before Fix:
- ❌ Session restoration timeout after 30s
- ❌ Falls back to QR code generation
- ❌ No S3 backup verification

### After Fix:
- ✅ Session restores from S3 within 60s
- ✅ No QR code required after restart
- ✅ Immediate messaging capability
- ✅ Proper S3 backup confirmation

## Key Improvements

1. **RemoteAuth Event Handling**: Added listeners for `remote_session_saved`, `authenticated`, and `disconnected` events
2. **Backup Verification**: Force backup with retry logic ensures S3 storage
3. **Better Timeouts**: Increased timeouts for RemoteAuth reliability
4. **S3 Existence Check**: Verify session exists in S3 before attempting restoration
5. **Enhanced Logging**: Better visibility into restoration process

## Monitoring Points

- Watch for "Session restored and ready" log message
- Check S3 backup confirmation logs
- Monitor restoration timeout (should not exceed 60s)
- Verify no QR code generation after restart
